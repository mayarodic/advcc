Hi! For this project we were intructed to create a website that was able to link to different pages using HTML and css. 

For this project I wanted to create a website that was simple and went along with my interest in food and being an extremly indecisive person. For this reason I created "WhatToCook", a website that navigates you through chosing what to cook. The viewer has different options, starting off with if they are Hungry or Starving, if they are craving something sweet or salty. Each final page has 5 "top recepies" for the week. The idea is that these will change on a weekly basis depending on what I put. Additionally, each final page has additional fun videos and tutorials as well as a cooking playlist. 

I was initially inspired to make the project due to my love for food and food blogs. My favorite food magazine is Bon Appetite. I love their YouTube and the way their website is formatted.  

he first page "Hungry or Starving", it leads into two seperate "Sweet or Salty" (depending on your choice) it directs to different pages. In total there are 7 pages.

Every weekly favorite links to a webpage with the original recepie. When I have more time I want to improve on this idea and add recepies as new pages so everything is on the same format. I would also like for these pages to be more colorful and different. It goes with the idea that until you make a final decision you are in a simple modern layout, until you reach the end and are rewarded with a colorful recepie.
