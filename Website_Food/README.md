WhatToCook?
For this project I wanted to create a website that was simple and went along with my interest in food and being an extremly indecisive person. For this reason I created "WhatToCook", a website that navigates you through chosing what to cook. The viewer has different options, starting off with if they are Hungry or Starving, if they are craving something sweet or salty. Each final page has 5 "top recepies" for the week. The idea is that these will change on a weekly basis depending on what I put. Additionally, each final page has additional fun videos and tutorials as well as a cooking playlist.

Inspiration
I was initially inspired to make the project due to my love for food and food blogs. My favorite food magazine is Bon Appetite. I love their YouTube and the way their website is formatted. Below are a few inspiration photos.

Final Website
Below are the images of my final website starting from the first page "Hungry or Starving", it leads into two seperate "Sweet or Salty" (depending on your choice) it directs to different pages. In total there are 7 pages.


Every weekly favorite links to a webpage with the original recepie. When I have more time I want to improve on this idea and add recepies as new pages so everything is on the same format. I would also like for these pages to be more colorful and different. It goes with the idea that until you make a final decision you are in a simple modern layout, until you reach the end and are rewarded with a colorful recepie.

Changes Made:
After receiving the feedback I decided to implement a new color scheme. I think this choice now gives the website a more interesting look that isnâ€™t too basic. I still wanted to keep the modern elements of the website with adding more color. I made sure to edit out the bullet points throughout the list, this now gives the website a cleaner look. I also added an about page that explains the objective of the site.
