This project was for my Advanced Crit Comp class. We were challanged to create a divinition project. 

Inspiration
For this divination assignment I wanted to focus on something that I wanted to learn more about. I have always been interested in palm readings and overall psychic readings. Whenever I have had my palms read I would never understand how it was done and what was the reasoning behind it. I initially wanted to do research to find out more. When looking at different websites I came across a wide variety of styles, some only did readings for certain lines others had websites dedicated to just one aspect of palm reading. For this reason, I had the inspiration to do an aesthetically pleasing palm reader that gives the person a reading for five different lines.

Above shows an example of what a regular website looked like. The interface was in my opinion outdated. For this reason I wanted to go in another direction and focus on the overall composition of aesthetics.

Sketching
My initial sketch is shown below. I created a hand with a black background, this contrast was very appealing to me. The different lines that I chose to show are also pictured below. From this initial brainstorm I really like the aesthetic and therefore wanted to translate this to the whole vision.

1.Open Website and click “start”
2.Examine the image that pops up on the screen
3.Use cursor to locate what line you want to inspect first
4.Click on like
5.Match up your hand with the image that looks most like the line on your hand
6.Click on the image
7.Read your future prediction
8.Go back by clicking “home page” and begin the same process for the other lines.
Website
Link to site: Website Link Link to site: Repo Link

The website initially starts with a title “The Palm Reader” with the initial improved image of the hand. Below are corresponding names for each colored line that when clicked take you to a new page with different images of lines (length/waves/thickness). When you hover over the image that corresponds to your palms line, text appears that analyzes what it means. I was thinking of using the elements of javascript with having a randomized “future” being told once you clicked on an image, however, palm readings stay the same depending on what you have.

For this reason I had the idea to add a button that when you put in your birthday it would calculate your star sign. It would be an astrology search which I found to be very fitting with the palm reader. However, my code didn’t seem to work, I ran into the issue of having the bar show up and work with its input but the answer wasn’t showing up.


Due to this not working I just decided to add something that I knew would work and that was a button when clicked it would show the time of your current location. This addition goes with the project requirements. However, I do hope to add the astrology button instead as it makes more sense for the purpose of my website.

Overall, I really enjoyed this project. I find what I created to be really aesthetically pleasing, I love how simple it is. I did run into some problems with my hovering and javascript. For this reason, when I get the chance to add onto it I would love to change the button and to improve the hovering on the images. Additionally, there is a lot more to palm reading such as the crossing of lines, where a line starts, how it compares to your other hand. For this reason it would be nice to improve on and add all these elements. My future vision is to add different “themes” for example the original palm reader had the black background, and then the fire/air palm reader would have a sunset background. This would make it more diverse and interesting.

Changes Made
The biggest thing that I was missing was a JS script file that was working with the rest to create an input and output. As I mentioned above in my process I wanted to add a zodiac sign element as this correlates to palm readings and to reading the future. For this reason, I added a “calculator” in a separate page that gives you a life prediction once you put in your star sign. This code doesn’t involve the different dates and times and therefore was more manageable to implement into this project.
