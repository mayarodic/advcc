This project was for my Advanced Crit Comp class. We were challanged to create a divinition project. 

Process: 

For this divination assignment I wanted to focus on something that I wanted to learn more about. I have always been interested in palm readings and overall psychic readings. Whenever I have had my palms read I would never understand how it was done and what was the reasoning behind it. I initially wanted to do research to find out more. When looking at different websites I came across a wide variety of styles, some only did readings for certain lines others had websites dedicated to just one aspect of palm reading. For this reason, I had the inspiration to do an aesthetically pleasing palm reader that gives the person a reading for five different lines. 


The website initially starts with a title “The Palm Reader” with the initial improved image of the hand. Below are corresponding names for each colored line that when clicked take you to a new page with different images of lines (length/waves/thickness). When you hover over the image that corresponds to your palms line, text appears that analyzes what it means. I was thinking of using the elements of javascript with having a randomized “future” being told once you clicked on an image, however, palm readings stay the same depending on what you have. 

For this reason I had the idea to add a button that when you put in your birthday it would calculate your star sign. It would be an astrology search which I found to be very fitting with the palm reader. However, my code didn’t seem to work, I ran into the issue of having the bar show up and work with its input but the answer wasn’t showing up. 

Due to this not working I just decided to add something that I knew would work and that was a button when clicked it would show the time of your current location. This addition goes with the project requirements. However, I do hope to add the astrology button instead as it makes more sense for the purpose of my website. 

Overall, I really enjoyed this project. I find what I created to be really aesthetically pleasing, I love how simple it is. I did run into some problems with my hovering and javascript. For this reason, when I get the chance to add onto it I would love to change the button and to improve the hovering on the images. Additionally, there is a lot more to palm reading such as the crossing of lines, where a line starts, how it compares to your other hand. For this reason it would be nice to improve on and add all these elements. My future vision is to add different “themes” for example the original palm reader had the black background, and then the fire/air palm reader would have a sunset background. This would make it more diverse and interesting.
